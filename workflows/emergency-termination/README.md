Emergency Terminations

This workflow can be invoked from any target system (eg SAP) that supports API calls. Once triggered it will disable the identity access and target account (eg. AD) immediately. You will have to modify the workflow to populate the actual workflow ID in the trigger and also modify any source ids as required in the Manage Accounts step.
