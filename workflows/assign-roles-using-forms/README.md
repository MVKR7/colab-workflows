Assign Roles using Forms

This workflow sends a form to the manager for selecting roles that can/need to be added to a new hire user. Once he submits the form, tho selected roles are provisioned to the user. If there is no approval scheme setup they will be auto approved and provisioned. If there is an approval scheme defined for the roles, an access request will be started and notification will be sent out to the first approver. Once access request is approved, the role will be provisioned.

Please modify the receipient email address in Send Email action in the workflow.
